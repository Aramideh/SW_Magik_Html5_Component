# GE Smallworld Magik Html5_Component Example 

### Introduction

The HTML5 component is a SWIFT component which can be embedded into any control and used to embed rich HTML5 user interfaces into any Smallworld application.( GE Documentation )

The API is very simple, but also very powerful: there are only three functions exposed in JavaScript and two exposed in Magik.( GE Documentation )


This example illustrates the implementation of a basic button and input using HTML5 technologies. ( GE Documentation )
